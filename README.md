State Background Images
---

Civil Services created high-resolution Landscape & Skyline Background Images for each US State and made them available in the following sizes:

* 640 x 360
* 960 x 540
* 1280 x 720
* 1920 x 1080

#### Landscape Images

The Landscape image ( `landscape_background_url` ) are nice images of landscapes you can find in each state.

The default size is `1280x720`.  You will need to replace that string in the URL if you wish to use a different size.

__Sample Image__

![oregon](images/backgrounds/640x360/landscape/oregon.jpg "oregon")

#### Skyline Images

The Skyline image ( `skyline_background_url` ) are nice images of city skylines you can find in each state.

The default size is `1280x720`.  You will need to replace that string in the URL if you wish to use a different size.

__Sample Image__

![New York](images/backgrounds/640x360/skyline/new-york.jpg "New York")

__NOTE:__  All images were optimized for a balance in quality and file size.

State Flag Images
---

There are two sizes for each `state_flag_url`.

* `idaho-small.png` ( all small flags are 150 x 100 pixels )
* `idaho-large.png` ( all large flags are 600 x 400 pixels )

The default size listed in the data set is suffixed with `-large.jpg`.  You will need to replace that string in the URL if you wish to use a different size.

CDN Image Usage
---

You can either copy the `./images/` folder into your project, or we also offer a CDN.

If you are using the image `./images/backgrounds/1280x720/landscape/alabama.jpg` the CDN for that file would be `https://cdn.civil.services/us-states/backgrounds/1280x720/landscape/alabama.jpg`

The main data file is `data/states.json` and is the only one you need to make changes too.  Once changes are made
you can automatically generate the CSV, SQL, XML & YML files automagically by running the following in a terminal window:

```bash
npm install
npm run convert
```
